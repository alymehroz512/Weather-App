# Project-19 Weather App in JavaScript
This is a simple, responsive weather application developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to search for weather information by city, displaying current conditions, temperature, humidity, wind speed, and more. The app fetches real-time weather data from the OpenWeather API and includes unit toggles for Celsius and Fahrenheit. Users can explore detailed weather data, including min/max temperatures and "feels like" values, for any chosen city.
